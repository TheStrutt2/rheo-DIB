# rheo-DIB

Code for analysis of spectra in the wavelength region of 200 - 1000 nm. Absorbance in UV region attributed to molecular absorption, used to observe label free simple diffusion across lipid interfaces as modelled by Ficks first law. 

Permeability of lipid interface to variable analytes is described in terms of P - the permeability coefficent.
